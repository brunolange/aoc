Given that $(a, b, c)$ pass the triangle test, we can anchor the first point at the origin and the second one at $(a,0)$. The last is located at:

$$
(\frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2a}, \sqrt{c^2 - \frac{a^4+b^4+c^4 + 2(a^2c^2 - a^2b^2 - b^2c^2)}{4a^2}})
$$

That's the solution to the system:

$$
(x - a)^2 + y^2 = b^2 \\
x^2       + y^2 = c^2
$$
